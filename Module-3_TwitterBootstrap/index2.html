                        <h3 class="text-center">Great Pyramid of Giza</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza                                 pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to                                 remain largely intact.<br>
                            Based on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that                                the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10- to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially standing at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great                                    Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years until Lincoln Cathedral was finished in 1311 AD. It is                                            estimated that the pyramid weighs approximately 6 million tonnes, and consists of 2.3 million blocks of limestone and granite, some weighing                                        as much as 80 tonnes.<br>
                            Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by limestone casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core                                  structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and                                      alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was                                     built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place. The Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several                                         buildings including small pyramids.<br>
                            There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built and was                                        unfinished. The Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure. The main part of the Giza complex is a set of                                        buildings that included two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile), three smaller pyramids for                                        Khufu's wives, an even smaller "satellite" pyramid, a raised causeway connecting the two temples, and small tombs for nobles surrounding the                                        pyramid.

                        <h3 class="text-center">Taj Mahal</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Taj Mahal ('Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was                                commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also                                    houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest                                          house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.<br>
                            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj                                    Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in                                   2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $916 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the                                           guidance an architects board.<br>
                            The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired                                 masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The                                  Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.
                                    The Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large                                           palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land. An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce                                          seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above riverbank. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form                                              the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The imperial                                              court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj                                                 Mahal.

                        <h3 class="text-center">Great Wall of China</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Great Wall of China (Chinese: 萬里長城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng) is the collective name of a series of fortification systems generally built                                   across the historical northern borders of China to protect and consolidate territories of Chinese states and empires against various nomadic groups                                 of the steppe and their polities. Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century BC by ancient Chinese states; selective                                           stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many                                      successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by                                           the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).<br>
                            Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the                                Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the                                    Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of                                        smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
                            The Great Wall of China is an ancient wall in China. The wall is made of cement, rocks, bricks, and powdered dirt. It was finished in 1878 and it was                               meant to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196                                        kilometres (13,171 miles) long, 9.1 metres (30 feet) wide and 15 metres (50 feet) high. The earlier sections on the wall are made of compacted                                      dirt and stone. Later in the Ming Dynasty they used bricks. There are 7,000 watch towers, block houses for soldiers and beacons to send smoke                                       signals.
                            Nineteen walls have been built that were called the Great Wall of China. The first was built in the 7th century BC.
